# 👋 Hi, I’m Malik Huraira

I’m a **backend-focused software engineer** who enjoys building **scalable, real-time systems** using **Java, Spring Boot, and modern backend technologies**.  
I like working close to the system core—APIs, data pipelines, messaging, and performance-critical services.

I’m especially interested in **microservices**, **event-driven architectures**, and **distributed systems**, and I enjoy learning by building real-world systems.

## 🔧 What I Work With
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL / PostGIS, MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Messaging & Streaming:** Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams  
- **Caching & State:** Redis, RocksDB  
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Git  
- **Concepts:** Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, Real-Time Processing

## 🚀 Things I’ve Built
- Real-time **fleet tracking & geofencing** systems with Kafka and PostGIS  
- **Scalable e-commerce backend APIs** with authentication and caching  
- Event-driven alert pipelines (speed, geofence, idle detection)  
- Backend services optimized for performance and reliability  

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- System design & distributed systems  
- Kafka Streams and stateful processing  
- Database performance tuning  
- Observability & monitoring (Prometheus)
